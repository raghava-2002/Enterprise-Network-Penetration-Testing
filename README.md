# Enterprise Network Penetration Testing (Capture the Flag)  

## Course: Ethical Hacking (EN2720) ‚Äì KTH Royal Institute of Technology  
**Duration:** Aug 2023 ‚Äì Oct 2023  
**Objective:**  
This project involved **penetration testing on a simulated corporate network** in a controlled lab environment. The goal was to **identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, escalate privileges, and capture security flags**, mimicking real-world cybersecurity attacks.

## üîç Attack Methodology  

### **1. Reconnaissance & Enumeration**  
**Scanned the network using Nmap** to identify live hosts, services, and open ports.  
**Performed web crawling** to find hidden directories and vulnerabilities.  
**Analyzed traffic using Wireshark** to identify unencrypted credentials.  

### **2Ô∏è. Exploitation**  
**SQL Injection (SQLMap) to dump database credentials.**  
**Brute-forced SSH & FTP logins using Hydra.**  
**Exploited Apache Tomcat‚Äôs misconfigured manager console to deploy a reverse shell.**  

### **33. Privilege Escalation**  
**Kernel exploits** to escalate privileges on a misconfigured Linux server.  
**Used Mimikatz to dump Windows credentials and escalate privileges.**  

### **4Ô∏è. Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement**  
**Maintained access by deploying persistent backdoors.**  
**Pivoted to other systems using compromised credentials.**  
**Captured high-value security flags from database servers.**   


### **5Ô∏è. WiFi & Cloud Security Assessments**
**Traffic Sniffing (Wireshark)** ‚Äì Captured and analyzed packets to detect **unencrypted credentials & ARP spoofing attacks**.  
**WiFi Cracking (Aircrack-ng)** ‚Äì Captured WPA2 handshakes and attempted **brute-force key recovery attacks**.  
**Cloud Exploitation** ‚Äì Identified **misconfigured cloud storage & IAM policy vulnerabilities** for privilege escalation.
