# Enterprise Network Penetration Testing (Capture the Flag)  

## Course: Ethical Hacking (EN2720) – KTH Royal Institute of Technology  
**Duration:** Aug 2023 – Oct 2023  
**Objective:**  
This project involved **penetration testing on a simulated corporate network** in a controlled lab environment. The goal was to **identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, escalate privileges, and capture security flags**, mimicking real-world cybersecurity attacks.

---

## What I Did  
- **Reconnaissance & Network Scanning**: Identified live hosts & open ports using **Nmap**.  
- **Web & Database Exploitation**: Used **SQL Injection (SQLMap), password brute-forcing (Hydra), and Metasploit exploits**.  
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gained admin/root access via **kernel exploits, misconfigured sudo, and credential dumping (Mimikatz)**.  
- **Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement**: Established persistence, **exfiltrated data, and escalated system access**.  
- **WiFi & Cloud Security Assessments**: Explored **traffic sniffing (Wireshark), WiFi cracking (Aircrack-ng), and cloud vulnerabilities**.

## Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Reconnaissance:** Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite  
- **Exploitation:** SQLMap, Metasploit, Hydra  
- **Privilege Escalation:** Mimikatz, Linux Exploit Suggester  
- **Post-Exploitation:** Netcat, reverse shells, PowerShell  
- **WiFi & Cloud Attacks:** Aircrack-ng, FoxyProxy
